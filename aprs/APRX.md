# APRX — APRS eXtended messaging protocol

APRX is a thin set of **conventions layered on top of standard APRS**. Every
APRX frame is a 100% valid APRS frame: a vanilla APRS client shows it as
ordinary text and ignores the parts it doesn't understand. APRX adds, purely
through how the text/addressee fields are filled in:

- multi‑line (long) messages,
- group messages (bulletins) with **local vs global** scope,
- message **threads** (replies),
- **reactions** ("likes"),
- **public‑key announcements** (callsign → key, for later encrypted DMs),
- **geo‑chat** (area broadcast text).

There is **no new packet type, no binary framing, no handshake**. If you can
send and receive APRS messages/bulletins/position reports, you can speak APRX.

This document is the wire contract so other apps can interoperate. It describes
two transports — APRS‑IS (TNC2) and APRS‑over‑BLE — but the *semantics* are the
same on both.

---

## 1. Design principles

1. **Backward compatible.** An APRX frame is a legal APRS frame. Non‑APRX
   clients still display the body; they just see markers like `+b9fb ` or
   `b9fb:like` as plain text.
2. **Stateless & derivable.** A message's identity is *computed from its own
   content* (§3), so any receiver derives the same id without a registry,
   sequence negotiation, or extra fields. Threads/likes reference that id.
3. **Transport‑agnostic.** The same conventions ride APRS‑IS and BLE. The only
   difference is framing/size limits.
4. **Scope is a receiver concept.** "Local" vs "global" is decided by *how you
   filter*, not by anything on the wire (§7). The transmitted bytes are
   identical.

### Limits

| | APRS‑IS (TNC2) | BLE compact advert |
|---|---|---|
| Message body | **67** chars (`APRS_MAX_MSG_LEN`) | keep whole frame ≤ ~27 bytes |
| Bulletin body | 67 chars/line, up to **10 lines** (BLN0–BLN9) | as above |
| Position comment | 107 chars | as above |

Anything longer is split (§5) on APRS‑IS, or sent over the chunked/GATT BLE
parcel transport on capable hardware (see `BLE_PROTOCOL.md`).

---

## 2. Transports

### 2.1 APRS‑IS / TNC2

Standard APRS over an APRS‑IS connection. Frames are normal TNC2 lines. Login
uses a computed passcode; the server‑side filter is `r/<lat>/<lon>/<km>`
optionally extended with `g/...` terms (§7).

- **Direct message:** `FROM>APRS,TCPIP*::ADDRESSEE :text{seq`
  - `ADDRESSEE` is the callsign, **uppercased and space‑padded to 9 chars**.
  - `{seq` is an incrementing message number (used for ack + multi‑line merge).
- **Bulletin (group):** `FROM>APRS,TCPIP*::BLN<id><GROUP>:text`
  - addressee = `BLN` + one line‑id char + group name, **padded to 9 chars**.
  - bulletins carry **no `{seq`** and are never acked.
- **Position:** `FROM>APRS,<path>:!<DDMM.mmN><symtable><DDDMM.mmW><symcode><comment>`

### 2.2 APRS‑over‑BLE (compact)

Connectionless broadcast in manufacturer data (company id `0xFFFF`). Fields are
separated by the unit‑separator byte `0x1F`:

```
<from> 0x1F <to> 0x1F <text>
```

- `to` routing target:
  - a callsign → 1:1 message
  - `#GRP` → group/bulletin message (group name only, **no scope marker**)
  - `!` → position; `text` = `lat,lon[,comment]` (decimal degrees)
  - empty → area / geo‑chat broadcast text (may begin `>>`)

The **payload semantics below (threads, likes, pubkey, geo‑chat) apply
identically to the BLE `text` field.** See `BLE_PROTOCOL.md` for the byte‑level
advert format, dedup, and BLE↔APRS‑IS relaying.

---

## 3. Message id (the foundation)

Every group message has a short **message id (`mid`)**: the **first 4 lowercase
hex characters** (= first 2 bytes) of the SHA‑1 of the string

```
<from> "|" <text>
```

where:
- `<from>` is the sender callsign exactly as it appears in the frame,
- `<text>` is the **exact transmitted body** — *including* any leading thread
  marker (§6). The id is computed over the raw wire text, even though the marker
  is stripped before display.

```
mid = lowerhex( SHA1( from + "|" + wire_text ) )[0:4]
```

**Worked example** (byte‑identical to standard SHA‑1):

```
from = "X1TX"
text = "GROUPTEST12175 hi"
SHA1("X1TX|GROUPTEST12175 hi") = b9fb...   →  mid = "b9fb"
```

This id is stable, content‑derived, and identical for every receiver, so it can
be referenced by threads and likes without any coordination. Ids are only
defined for **group** traffic (§5/§6); 1:1 messages don't use them.

> Collision note: 16 bits (65 536 values) is enough for a human‑scale group
> conversation. A receiver scopes ids per group + recent window; implementers
> may widen to 6–8 hex if they need more, but **must** keep the
> `first‑N‑hex‑of‑sha1(from|text)` rule so ids agree across apps.

---

## 4. Direct (1:1) messages

Plain APRS messages addressed to a callsign. No APRX additions beyond §5
(multi‑line). Threads/likes/scope do **not** apply to 1:1.

```
X10EGL>APRS,TCPIP*::CT1ABC   :see you at the repeater{12
```

---

## 5. Multi‑line (long) messages

A body longer than the limit is split into multiple frames; the receiver
concatenates them back.

**Splitting rule** (APRSdroid‑compatible): break at the **last space at or
before `max_len`**; only hard‑break a single word that itself exceeds `max_len`.
Trailing spaces of a chunk and the gap before the next chunk are trimmed; parts
are rejoined with a single space.

- **Direct messages:** each chunk is a normal message with its **own
  incrementing `{seq`**. The receiver merges consecutive parts from the same
  sender. (`aprs_send_message_multi`.)
- **Bulletins:** each chunk is line **`0,1,2,…`** of the same group, encoded in
  the bulletin **line id** (`BLN0GRP`, `BLN1GRP`, …). Capped at **10 lines**
  (`BLN0`–`BLN9`). Receiver orders by line id. (`aprs_send_bulletin_multi`.)

```
X10EGL>APRS,TCPIP*::BLN0NET  :Weekly net tonight 2000Z on the
X10EGL>APRS,TCPIP*::BLN1NET  :club repeater — all welcome, bring
X10EGL>APRS,TCPIP*::BLN2NET  :a friend.
```

---

## 6. Group messages (bulletins)

A group message is an APRS **bulletin** whose addressee is `BLN<id><GROUP>`:

- `<id>` — line id (`0`–`9`), used to order multi‑line bulletins (§5).
- `<GROUP>` — group name: **1–5 chars, uppercased, alphanumeric**, the rest of
  the 9‑char addressee field space‑padded.

```
addressee = "BLN" + line_id + GROUP, padded to 9
e.g.  BLN0NEWS , BLN0WX   , BLN0NOSTR
```

The frame's **`from` field is the author's callsign**. Bulletins are broadcast:
anyone whose filter selects them receives them.

```
X10EGL>APRS,TCPIP*::BLN0NEWS :repeater PI3UTR back on air
```

Over BLE the same message is `from 0x1F #NEWS 0x1F repeater PI3UTR back on air`.

### Reserved group names

| Group | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NOSTR` | Public‑key announcements (§9). Receivers should treat these as identity records, not chat. |

---

## 7. Local vs global scope

**Scope is not on the wire.** The transmitted bulletin for `NEWS` is the same
whether the sender thinks of it as local or global. Scope is how the *receiver*
chooses to pull the group:

- **Local** — rely on the standard area filter `r/<lat>/<lon>/<km>`. You see a
  group's bulletins only from senders inside your radius. (APRS‑IS positions the
  sender; BLE is inherently in‑range.)
- **Global** — additionally ask APRS‑IS for the group worldwide with a bulletin
  filter term. Aurora adds a single catch‑all **`g/BLN*`** when any global group
  is subscribed, then files only the groups the user actually joined.

> **APRS‑IS `g/` gotcha (verified live against aprsc):** `g/` has **no
> mid‑string wildcard**. `g/BLN?NEWS` and `g/BLN*NEWS` both **miss**. Only an
> exact addressee (`g/BLN0NEWS`) or a **trailing** wildcard (`g/BLN*`) match.
> Because worldwide bulletin volume is tiny, the `g/BLN*` catch‑all + local
> filtering is the practical approach.

A client may represent the two views as two subscriptions (e.g. `#NEWS` local,
`#NEWS*` global). That `*` is a **local UI marker only** — it is stripped before
transmitting; the wire group is always the bare name.

---

## 8. Threads (replies)

A reply is an ordinary group message whose **body begins with a thread marker**:

```
+<pmid><SP><reply text>
```

- `+` literal,
- `<pmid>` — the 4‑hex `mid` (§3) of the message being replied to,
- one space, then the reply text.

```
X1BOB>APRS,TCPIP*::BLN0TEST :+b9fb agreed, see you there
```

Receiver behaviour:
- Detect the marker (`+`, 4 hex, space). Record `parent = b9fb`.
- **Strip the marker for display**; show the remainder as the message text.
- This reply's **own `mid` is computed over the FULL body including the marker**
  (`SHA1("X1BOB|+b9fb agreed, see you there")[0:4]`), so replies can be
  replied to in turn.

Non‑APRX clients simply show `+b9fb agreed, see you there` verbatim — still
readable. Threads are **group‑only**.

---

## 9. Reactions ("likes")

A like is an ordinary group message whose **entire body** is:

```
<mid>:like
<mid>:unlike      (retracts)
```

- `<mid>` — the 4‑hex id (§3) of the target message,
- the verb is exactly `like` or `unlike`.

```
X1ZED>APRS,TCPIP*::BLN0TEST :b9fb:like
```

Receiver behaviour:
- Recognise the form `^[0-9a-f]{4}:(like|unlike)$` and treat it as a **vote, not
  a chat message** (don't render it as a bubble, don't notify).
- Tally by **liker callsign** (the frame `from`): each callsign counts **once**;
  a repeat `:like` is idempotent; `:unlike` removes that callsign's vote.
- The deliberately human‑readable form (no special byte) lets **any** APRS
  client like a message by sending e.g. `b9fb:like` to the group.

Likes are group‑only and ride the same transports (APRS‑IS bulletin / BLE
`#GRP`).

---

## 10. Public‑key announcement

A station periodically advertises its public key so peers can build a
**callsign → public‑key** map and later send it **encrypted** messages.

- Transport: a **bulletin to the reserved group `NOSTR`** (§6), and the same
  over BLE (`#NOSTR`).
- **Body = the 32‑byte public key, base64url‑encoded, no padding = 43 chars.**
  (The key is a Nostr/`secp256k1` x‑only public key — the 32 bytes an `npub`
  bech32 string encodes. base64url is used instead of the 63‑char `npub` so the
  record fits one 67‑char APRS message and a small BLE advert.)

```
X10EGL>APRS,TCPIP*::BLN0NOSTR:flH3-_InWKh9SjUYCetLr5rBgozalyqyTiJA1fH4kHI
```

Mapping for a receiver:
- `callsign` = frame `from` (here `X10EGL`),
- `pubkey`  = `base64url_decode(body)` → 32 raw bytes (use directly for NIP‑04 /
  NIP‑44 encryption, or re‑encode to `npub` for display).

Recommended cadence: low (the key rarely changes) — Aurora sends every **30
min**. A receiver should treat repeats as refreshes of the same record.

> The base64url alphabet is `A–Z a–z 0–9 - _`. Encode the raw 32 bytes and strip
> any `=` padding. Decoding is the inverse.

---

## 11. Geo‑chat (area broadcast text)

Free‑text "anyone around?" chatter tied to a location, carried as the **comment
of a position report**, prefixed with `>>`:

```
X10EGL>APRS,TCPIP*:!3843.34N/00908.36W>>>net starting now
```

(`>` is the symbol code; `>>` then begins the comment.) Long geo‑chat is sent as
several position reports, each comment chunk prefixed `>>`. Over BLE it's the
empty‑`to` form: `from 0x1F  0x1F >>net starting now`.

Receivers show these on a location‑scoped "live" view rather than as a
1:1/group conversation.

---

## 12. Worked end‑to‑end example

A small `TEST` group thread with a like and the author's key, as seen on
APRS‑IS:

```
# 1. original post  (mid = sha1("X1TX|hi there")[0:4] = … )
X1TX>APRS,TCPIP*::BLN0TEST :hi there

# 2. a reply to it  (parent = <mid of #1>; this reply has its own mid)
X1BOB>APRS,TCPIP*::BLN0TEST :+<mid1> agreed

# 3. someone likes the original (counts once per callsign)
X1ZED>APRS,TCPIP*::BLN0TEST :<mid1>:like

# 4. X1TX advertises its public key for encrypted replies
X1TX>APRS,TCPIP*::BLN0NOSTR:flH3-_InWKh9SjUYCetLr5rBgozalyqyTiJA1fH4kHI
```

A plain APRS client renders #1–#3 as readable bulletin text and #4 as a 43‑char
string; an APRX client renders a threaded, likeable conversation and learns
`X1TX`'s key.

---

## 13. Implementation checklist (for other apps)

To receive APRX:
1. Parse APRS messages, bulletins, and position reports as usual.
2. For each **bulletin**: extract `GROUP` (chars after `BLN<id>`, trim padding)
   and `line_id`; merge multi‑line by line id.
3. If `body` ends with ` ~<base85-run>` → split off the **signature** first
   (§14); verify it and keep the rest as `body`. Strip it before the next steps.
4. Compute `mid = sha1(from + "|" + body)[0:4]` (lowercase hex).
5. If `body` matches `^\+[0-9a-f]{4} ` → it's a **reply**: record parent, strip
   marker before display.
6. If `body` matches `^[0-9a-f]{4}:(like|unlike)$` → it's a **reaction**: update
   the per‑callsign tally; do not display.
7. If `GROUP == NOSTR` → it's a **key record**: store `from → base64url_decode(body)`.
8. Otherwise it's a normal group message.
9. Position comments beginning `>>` → geo‑chat.

To send APRX: emit the same forms. Keep each frame within the limits in §1;
split long bodies per §5.

---

## 14. Signed messages — verifiable authorship

Status: **implemented** (APRS wapp ≥ 0.2.18). Opt‑in per user setting. When on,
an outgoing message carries a compact signature so any peer can verify it came
from the sender's callsign key. Verifying needs the sender's public key, learned
from the §10 `NOSTR` beacon. Everything is on‑air — no relays, no lookup.

### 14.1 Signature scheme — short‑Schnorr `(e, s)`, 48 bytes

Signatures use the **same secp256k1 key behind the npub/callsign**, but in the
classic Schnorr `(e, s)` form rather than BIP‑340's `(R, s)`:

- `e` = challenge, truncated to **16 bytes** (128‑bit security),
- `s` = full **32‑byte** scalar (can't shrink — fixed by the curve order),
- **total = 48 bytes** = the smallest a secp256k1 signature can be.

`m = sha256("<FROM>|<core>")` is the signed digest. Sign: nonce `k` from a tagged
hash, `R = kG`, `e = first16( taggedHash("APRX/challenge", R.x ‖ P.x ‖ m) )`,
`s = (k + e·d') mod n` (with `d'` the even‑y key, BIP‑340 convention). Verify:
`R' = sG − eP`, check `first16(taggedHash("APRX/challenge", R'.x ‖ P.x ‖ m)) == e`.

This is an **APRX‑specific** scheme (NOT interoperable with BIP‑340/Nostr
verifiers); only APRX clients verify it. It reuses the existing key, so the §10
beacon and callsign binding are unchanged.

### 14.2 Encoding — APRS‑safe base85

48 bytes encode to **60 chars** (vs 64 for base64, 86 for a 64‑byte sig) using a
Z85‑style codec (4 bytes → 5 chars) over an **85‑char alphabet that excludes the
APRS‑reserved `{ | ~` and space**:

```
0-9 a-z A-Z .-+=^!/*?&<>()[]%$#@,;_
```

60 chars fits a single 67‑char APRS message.

### 14.3 What is signed

`core` = the message body **including** any thread marker `+<pmid> ` (§8) and
**excluding** the signature segment. `FROM` = the sender's callsign (the frame
source). Binding `FROM` + `core` proves *who authored this exact text*. Scope
(group/DM) is not bound — a genuine signed message could in principle be replayed
into another room, but it remains genuinely the author's words; `mid` dedup (§3)
limits repeats.

### 14.4 On‑air format

Append to the body: a space, a tilde, then the 60‑char base85 signature.

```
<core> ~<60-char base85 signature>
```

The base85 alphabet contains neither space nor `~`, so the split is unambiguous:
the signature is the trailing run of base85 chars and the `~` just before it;
everything earlier is `core`.

**Retro‑compatible multi‑line.** The signed body `<core> ~<sig>` is word‑split
into normal ≤67‑char APRS lines (§5). Because the 60‑char signature has no spaces
and is preceded by a space, the splitter always puts it on **its own final
line** — so a signed message is the body line(s) followed by a last line that is
just `~<sig>`:

```
X10EGL>APRS,TCPIP*::BLN0TEST :hi there            (body, line 0)
X10EGL>APRS,TCPIP*::BLN1TEST :~<60-char signature> (signature, last line)
```

For a direct message the parts are separate messages with consecutive `{seq`,
the last part being the `~<sig>` line. The receiver reassembles the lines (join
with single spaces), then strips the trailing ` ~<sig>` (§14.6). Each line stays
within the 67‑char APRS convention, so stock clients show normal text lines.
(BLE carries the whole body in one parcel — no split there.)

### 14.5 Setting

A per‑station **"Sign my messages"** toggle (default **off** — a signature adds a
line). Persisted in KV. Off → messages are sent plain (§4/§6). Likes (§9) and
key beacons (§10) are never signed.

### 14.6 Verification (receiver)

```
1. Reassemble multi-line parts (bulletins by line id; DMs by consecutive seq up
   to and including the final " ~<sig>" line), joined with single spaces.
2. If the body ends with " ~<base85-run>", split it: sig = decode(run); core = head.
   else → "unsigned".
3. Strip the signature BEFORE computing mid (§3) and thread/like parsing — so
   signing never changes ids; unsigned traffic is unaffected.
4. pubkey = lookup(FROM) from the §10 NOSTR map; none yet → "unverified".
5. m = sha256(FROM "|" core); ok = shortSchnorrVerify(sig, m, pubkey).
```

UI verdict: **verified** (green), **forged** (red, signature present but fails),
**unverified** (signed but sender's key not learned yet), or **unsigned** (no
badge).

### 14.7 Where the crypto runs

Signing and verifying happen **host‑side** (the private key never reaches the
wapp). The wapp builds the canonical bytes, asks the host to sign (returns the
base85 string), and appends it; on receive it hands the host `(pubkey, bytes,
sig)` to verify. A client SHOULD also check the callsign matches the key
(`npub(pubkey)[5:9].upper() == callsign[2:6]`).

### 14.8 Security notes

- **128‑bit** security; the unforgeable scalar is sent in full (no truncation).
- The `X1+4` callsign is a 20‑bit handle — always verify against the full key.
- Replay: dedup by `mid`; scope is not bound (see §14.3).
- The 16‑byte challenge gives 128‑bit existential‑forgery resistance; widen `e`
  to 24–32 bytes if a higher margin is ever wanted (at +5–10 chars).

---

## 15. Encrypted 1:1 messages

Status: **implemented** (APRS wapp ≥ 0.2.28). A direct message to a callsign
whose public key is in the keys database (§10) is end‑to‑end encrypted so only
that station can read it. Group messages are never encrypted.

### 15.1 Scheme

ECDH over secp256k1 + AES‑256‑CBC (NIP‑04‑style), using the same key pair behind
the npub/callsign:

```
shared = X coordinate of (my_private_scalar × lift_x(their_pubkey))   // 32 bytes
iv     = 16 random bytes
ct     = AES-256-CBC(key = shared, iv, PKCS7(plaintext))
blob   = iv ‖ ct
```

The X coordinate is parity‑independent, so `ecdh(a, B) == ecdh(b, A)` — sender
and recipient derive the same key, and the sender can also decrypt its own copy
(for the local echo). Confidentiality only; **the ciphertext is always signed
(§14)** so authenticity + integrity (and AES‑CBC malleability) are covered by the
signature, not by the cipher.

### 15.2 On‑air format

```
ENC1:<base64url(iv ‖ ct)>  ~<base85 signature>
```

`ENC1:` marks an encrypted body; the rest is the base64url blob; the message is
then signed (§14) and word‑split into multi‑line APRS (§5). Because the base64url
body has no spaces, multi‑line reassembly inserts artifact spaces into it — the
receiver **strips all spaces after `ENC1:`** before verifying the signature and
decrypting (the signature is computed over the space‑free `ENC1:<base64>`).

### 15.3 Send / receive

- **Send** (1:1 only): if the recipient's pubkey is known → encrypt to it,
  prefix `ENC1:`, sign, transmit. Otherwise send plaintext (e.g. to non‑APRX
  stations). Encryption is automatic when a key is on file.
- **Receive**: detect `ENC1:`, canonicalise (strip reassembly spaces), verify the
  signature with the sender's key, then decrypt with the **peer's** key (the
  sender for incoming; the recipient for our own echo) + our private key. Show
  the plaintext with a lock badge; if the peer's key is unknown or decryption
  fails, show `[encrypted - no key]` / `[encrypted - cannot decrypt]`.

### 15.4 Notes

- The private key never leaves the host (HAL `hal_encrypt` / `hal_decrypt`).
- Local message history is stored decrypted (the device owner reads their own
  chats); only the wire is encrypted.
- A station learns peers' keys passively from their §10 `NOSTR` beacons, so
  encryption “just works” once two APRX stations have heard each other's key.
